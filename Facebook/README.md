# Goals
This is my first independent project using HTML and CSS. My goal is simply to learn the capabilities and programing practices working with these two languages. The website in which I am striving to clone is the [Facebook Login](https://www.facebook.com/login.php/) since it was the most basic one I could find. <br />

&ensp; &nbsp;✅ &nbsp; &nbsp; Add hover to change the color for the two buttons and the "Forgot account" <br />
